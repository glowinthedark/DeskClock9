# DeskClock9

An always-on version of [Google's DeskClock](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.deskclock) which can be used as a night clock.

The mod adds the following extra features to the [orignal Android's stock clock](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/apps/DeskClock/):

* custom fonts for the screensaver clock
* automatic modification of the screen sleep timeout when the screensaver mode is triggered so that the screen does not go into sleep mode. When the screensaver mode is stopped (on touch) the original screen lock timeout is restored.
* additional widgets in the settings screen to set custom font sizes for the screensaver mode
* no date and day of the week on the screensaver mode clock
